# Creating your own Object Detector
The goal of this program is to create your own object detector from scratch. I was able to successfully do this using road sign images, but this program can be used for any image dataset.
### <p> Files included are: <p>
<p> Object Detection User Guide.docx: An in-depth user guide explaining how to use the program and how to add new images to the dataset/successfully run the program with your own dataset.
<p> Object Detection Final.jpynb: Final Object Detection notebook. This program successfully runs using the SSD_mobilenet_v2_coco (2018) model from TensorFlow.
<p> new train: folder containing training images (211 training images)
<p> new val: folder containing validation images (81 validation images)
<p> new train xml: folder containing xml files for training images (211 files)
<p> new val xml: folder containing xml files for validation images (81 files)
<p> test images: file containing test images (4 test images)
<p> Object_Detection_road_signs.jpynb: Alternative Object Detection notebook that successfully runs using the faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco (2018) model from TensorFlow.
